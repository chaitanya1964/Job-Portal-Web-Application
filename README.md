# Job-Portal-Web-Application
A Job Portal Web Application is a full stack platform that enables recruiters to post jobs and job seekers to search and apply for jobs online.

# Introduction

In the modern digital world, recruitment has shifted from traditional methods such as newspaper advertisements and walk-in interviews to online platforms. Job seekers often face difficulties in finding relevant job opportunities, while recruiters struggle to efficiently manage job postings and applications using manual or scattered systems. This creates a gap between employers and candidates, leading to inefficiency, time consumption, and lack of transparency.

The Job Portal Web Application is a full stack web-based system designed to bridge this gap by providing a centralized online platform where job seekers can search and apply for jobs, and recruiters can post job openings and manage applications. The system simplifies the recruitment process by automating job listings, resume submissions, application tracking, and communication between employers and candidates.

This project demonstrates the practical application of full stack development concepts, including frontend design, backend logic, database management, and secure authentication, making it suitable for real-world deployment and academic evaluation.
